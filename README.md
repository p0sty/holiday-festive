holiday-festive
===============

A simple festive animation for the Moorescloud Holiday light.

I couldn't find one in the defaults, so I added one :D

Merry Christmas everyone :)

I've done it in bash because it runs locally on the light if you're on window or easily on a linux or os x.

it's also a slightly modified example from the support site here:

http://support.moorescloud.com/2013/12/a-quick-introduction-to-the-api/

usage is ./festive.sh holidayipaddress.
