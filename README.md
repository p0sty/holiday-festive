holiday-festive
===============

A simple festive animation for the Moorescloud Holiday light.

This thin here, if you've never heard of it - http://www.moorescloud.com/

I couldn't find one in the defaults, so I added one :D

Merry Christmas everyone :)

I've done it in bash because it runs locally on the light (when ssh'd through developer mode) if you're on windows or easily remotely onlinux or os x as most have inbuilt python support.

it's also a slightly modified example from the support site here:

http://support.moorescloud.com/2013/12/a-quick-introduction-to-the-api/

usage is ./festive.sh holidayipaddress.
